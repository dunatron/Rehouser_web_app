        Instead of subscribing to a technology provider (as most Property
        Management agencies do) and offsetting the cost onto landlords, weâ€™ve
        developed our own software and offer direct access to all of our
        customers.
      </Typography>

      <Typography gutterBottom>
        We offer the full services of a Property Management agency, while giving
        full transparency into the process through your online {COMPANY_NAME}
        account.

      <Typography gutterBottom>
        {COMPANY_NAME} management is one part Property Investor and one part
        Coder, both with the drive to collaborate to offer better value for
        local landlords.
